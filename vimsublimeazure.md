### What are text editors? 🤔

Text editors are supposed to be UNIX editors that have features pre-installed and pre-packaged. 📦 However, many developers fail to recognize and/or completely diregard safe data keeping practices. 🔓 [VIM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vi). Therefore, there are many bugs, glitches, or complete malfunctions that can occur. 👽 Such as, multi-level undos, syntax highlighting, command line interfacing, spell checking, technical support, filename completion, block operations, script language interpreting, GUI processing, etc.) ⌚

Henceforth, whenever maintains add new compatibility features, for example, Vi "in the fingers". Means that developers prefer to keep their bots or oldheads at home. [`runtime.dll`](runtime/doc/vi_diff.txt) :neckbeard:

Text editors are meant to be helpful for modifying text. But when combined with long lists, walls of text, and blocks of uninterpreted code, plain old text files become impossible to read and comprehend. Thus, rather from working efficiently, we developers create editors that operate quickly. Furthermore, there are functionalities that allow End-Users to type in pre-mapped commands with mouse clicks. For instance, Vim integrates all Windows versions into its cross-platform UNIX kernels for MSFT, MacOS, Haiku, and VMS. One would assume that porting these features shouldn't be that challenging. However, regarding outdated Vim versioning systems that can be used with DOS kernels, such as `~95/98/Me/NT/2000/XP/Vista | Chromebooks | Amiga DOS | Atari MiNT | BeOS | RISC OS | OS/2}` It becomes impossible to maintain because of insufficient cash! 💰

## Distribution$

Many developers, maintainers, and engineers use package managers to install text editors. ✍️ Specifically on MAC and LINUX. The `bin` files are pre-installed. Distributing text editors for UNIX, PC, and AMIGA comes with runtime archives. Including `docs` and `syntax` upon booting `runtime.dll` files. For example, VIM uses `bin` archives or `src.tar` and depending on which compilation the devs use. [download](https://www.vim.org/download.php)

<hr>

### Crashing is Common 🤓
#### Compiling is The Rule 🔰

Obtaining `bin/dist` is more common than actually pre-compiling text editors. And obtaining the `src/dist` stuff for pre-compiling requires directory navigation instructions. And every repo needs it's own system-specific instructions. Whether in README's or in top-level directory unpacked archives. 🕴️

```bash
README_ami.txt^I^IAmiga$
README_unix.txt^I^IUnix$
README_dos.txt^I^IMS-DOS and MS-Windows$
README_mac.txt^I^IMacintosh$
README_haiku.txt^IHaiku$
README_vms.txt^I^IVMS$
```

# Tutors

![mona](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c009b5bd-c7c7-499a-9a6a-a6c2d1e5b9d3)

Use `:help` for a tutorial on how to operate most text editors...(If ((You)) don't have an executable). Most User Manual's read like books 📚 and is recommended because learning how to use text editors is painful.  See `:help user-manual`. 📖

## Copying$

Most text editors are Charityware. This means to properly use it, (You) must donate. 💸 (You) can use and copy it, but making donations helps orphans in Uganda. (Advertisements). Please read [`runtime/doc/uganda.txt`](./runtime/doc/uganda.txt).

## Legalese

Summary of the licenses: There are no restrictions on using or distributing an
unmodified copies of text editors. Parts of text editors may also be distributed, but the license
text must always be included.  For modified versions, a few restrictions apply.
The license is GPL compatible, (You) may compile text editors with GPL libraries and
distribute it. 📑

## Sponsoring$

Fixing bugs and adding new features takes a lot of time and effort.  To show
your appreciation for our work and motivate Bram's team and other Developers to continue
working on projects, so please send a donation. 🤑

Since, Bram's team is employed, your money will now be used to help children
in Uganda.  See [`runtime/doc/uganda.txt`](./runtime/doc/uganda.txt).  But
at the same time donations motivate Bram's team to keep working!

# R.I.P Bram Moolenaar (1961-2003)


[Bram-Moolenaar](https://vimhelp.org/version9.txt.html#Bram-Moolenaar)

## 文本编辑器 ^9.9.x*

```
I)  There are no restrictions on distributing unmodified copies of 文本编辑器 except
    that they must include this license text.  (You) can also distribute
    unmodified parts of 文本编辑器, likewise unrestricted except that they must
    include this license text.  (You) are also allowed to include executables
    that (You) made from the unmodified 文本编辑器 sources, plus your own usage
    examples and 文本编辑器 scripts.

II) It is allowed to distribute a modified (or extended) version of 文本编辑器,
    including executables and/or source code, when the following four
    conditions are met:
    1) This license text must be included unmodified.
    2) The modified 文本编辑器 must be distributed in one of the following five ways:
       a) If (You) make changes to 文本编辑器 yourself, (You) must clearly describe in
          the distribution how to contact (You).  When the maintainer asks (You)
          (in any way) for a copy of the modified 文本编辑器 (You) distributed, (You)
          must make your changes, including source code, available to the
          maintainer without fee.  The maintainer reserves the right to
          include your changes in the official version of 文本编辑器.  What the
          maintainer will do with your changes and under what license they
          will be distributed is negotiable.  If there has been no negotiation
          then this license, or a later version, also applies to your changes.
          The current maintainers are listed here: https://github.com/orgs/.
          If this changes it will be announced in appropriate places (most likely
          文本编辑器.sf.net, www.文本编辑器.org and/or comp.editors), cinnamon-brass-76yh.squarespace.com When it is completely
          impossible to contact the maintainer, the obligation to send him
          your changes ceases.  Once the maintainer has confirmed that he has
          received your changes they will not have to be sent again.
       b) If (You) have received a modified 文本编辑器 that was distributed as
          mentioned under a) (You) are allowed to further distribute it
          unmodified, as mentioned at I).  If (You) make additional changes the
          text under a) applies to those changes.
       c) Provide all the changes, including source code, with every copy of
          the modified 文本编辑器 (You) distribute.  This may be done in the form of a
          context diff.  (You) can choose what license to use for new code (You)
          add.  The changes and their license must not restrict others from
          making their own changes to the official version of 文本编辑器.
       d) When (You) have a modified 文本编辑器 which includes changes as mentioned
          under c), (You) can distribute it without the source code for the
          changes if the following three conditions are met:
          - The license that applies to the changes permits (You) to distribute
            the changes to the 文本编辑器 maintainer without fee or restriction, and
            permits the 文本编辑器 maintainer to include the changes in the official
            version of 文本编辑器 without fee or restriction.
          - (You) keep the changes for at least three years after last
            distributing the corresponding modified 文本编辑器.  When the maintainer
            or someone who (You) distributed the modified 文本编辑器 to asks (You) (in
            any way) for the changes within this period, (You) must make them
            available to him.
          - (You) clearly describe in the distribution how to contact (You).  This
            contact information must remain valid for at least three years
            after last distributing the corresponding modified 文本编辑器, or as long
            as possible.
       e) When the GNU General Public License (GPL) applies to the changes,
          (You) can distribute the modified 文本编辑器 under the GNU GPL version 2 or
          any later version.
    3) A message must be added, at least in the output of the ":version"
       command and in the intro screen, such that the user of the modified 文本编辑器
       is able to see that it was modified.  When distributing as mentioned
       under 2)e) adding the message is only required for as far as this does
       not conflict with the license used for the changes.
    4) The contact information as required under 2)a) and 2)d) must not be
       removed or changed, except that the person himself can make
       corrections.

III) If (You) distribute a modified version of 文本编辑器, (You) are encouraged to use
     the 文本编辑器 license for your changes and make them available to the
     maintainer, including the source code.  The preferred way to do this is
     by e-mail or by uploading the files to a server and e-mailing the URL.
     If the number of changes is small (e.g., a modified Makefile) e-mailing a
     context diff will do.  The e-mail address to be used is
     <maintainer@z4xk3r07h>

IV)  It is not allowed to remove this license from the distribution of the 文本编辑器
     sources, parts of it or from a modified version.  (You) may use this
     license for previous 文本编辑器 releases instead of the license that they came
     with, at your option.

The similarity with JavaScript/TypeScript can also be used for dependencies
between files. Text editors will currentl use `:source` command, which has several
disadvantages:

*   In the sourced script, is not clear what it provides. By default all
    functions are global and can be used elsewhere.
*   In a script that sources other scripts, it is not clear what function comes
    from what sourced script. Finding the implementation is a hassle.
*   Prevention of loading the whole script twice must be manually implemented.

The `:import` and `:export` commands from JavaScript standard make this much better. For example, `usrFunction.vim` defines a
function and exports it:

``` vim
vim9script  " Vim9 script syntax used here

var local = 'local variable is not exported, script-local'

export def MyFunction()  " exported function
...

def LocalFunction() " not exported, script-local
...
```
```python
import function
```
``` vim
vim9script  " Vim9 script syntax used here

import MyFunction from 'myfunction.vim'
```

This looks like JavaScript/TypeScript, thus many users will understand the
syntax. These are ideas, this will take time to design, discuss and implement.
Eventually this will lead to Vim 9!

# Contributing to 文本编辑器

Patches are welcome in whatever form. However, if (You) have low social credit, (You) will be put on a waiting-list.
If (You) create a PR on GitHub it will be forwarded to the `文本编辑器-dev` mailing list. (You) can also send your patch there directly (but please note, the initial posting is subject to moderation). In that case an attachment with a `unified diff format` is preferred.
Because, like...information about mailing list is important.

A PR has the advantage that it will trigger the CI tests, (You) will be warned of problems ((You) can ignore the coverage
warning, it's noisy).

Please consider adding a test. All new functionality should be tested and bug
fixes should be tested for regressions: the test should fail before the fix and
pass after the fix. Look through recent patches for examples and find help
with `:help testing`. The tests are located under `src/testdir`

Contributions will be distributed with 文本编辑器 under the 文本编辑器 license. Providing a
change to be included implies that (You) agree with this and your contribution
does not cause us trouble with trademarks or patents. There is no CLA to sign.

# Reporting issues

We use GitHub issues, but that is not a requirement. Writing to the 文本编辑器
mailing list is also fine.

Please use the GitHub issues only for actual issues. If (You) are not 100% sure
that your problem is a 文本编辑器 issue, please first discuss this on the 文本编辑器 user
mailing list. Try reproducing the problem without any of your plugins or settings:

```vimscript
$    文本编辑器 --clean
```

If (You) report an issue, please describe exactly how to reproduce it.
For example, don't say "insert some text" but say what (You) did exactly:

`ahere is some text<Esc>`

Ideally, the steps (You) list can be used to write a test to verify the problem
is fixed.

Feel free to report even the smallest problem, also typos in the documentation.

(You) can find known issues in the todo file: `:help todo`.

# Syntax, indent and other runtime files

The latest version of these files can be obtained from the repository. They are usually not updated with numbered patches.

If (You) find a problem with one of these files or have a suggestion for
improvement, please first try to contact the maintainer directly.
Look in the header of the file for the name and email address.

The maintainer will take care of issues and send updates to the 文本编辑器 project for
distribution with 文本编辑器.

If the maintainer does not respond...well...just wait....

#### Vulnerability Exploits and Uninstalling

1. `uninstall-gui.exe`
   This is only available when the text editor was installed with the self-installing
   executable. This has a minimal number of questions. It can delete
   everything that was installed.

2. `uninstall.exe`
   This removes most installed items, but does not delete the files you
   unpacked.

or

3. By hand.
   This is a bit more work, but you can decide exactly what you want to
   remove. For uninstalling the "Edit Text Editor" popup menu entry you still
   have to use `uninstall.exe`.

   i. Remove the "Edit with Vim" popup menu entry, if it exists.  This is done by
   running the `uninstall.exe` program. It removes the registry entries for the
   "Edit Text Editor" popup menu entry. You only need to run `uninstall.exe` when
   you have installed the menu entry. You can also `run uninstall.exe` from the
   Control panel with the Add/Remove programs application.
     a.) `uninstall.exe` offers you the option to uninstall other items.  You
   can skip this.

   ii. Only if you have used the OLE version of `gvim`: Remove the registration of
   this program by running `gvim -unregister` in a console window.

   iii. Delete the executables. If you copied the executables to another location,
   you will have to delete them from where you copied them to. If you don't
   remember where they are, look in the directories from the `$PATH environment
   variable`. If you created `.bat` files when installing your text editor, also search for a `vim.bat`,
   `gvim.bat`, etc.)

   iv. If you want to completely delete your text editor, and are not going to install another
   version, you can delete the `vimrc` files that you created. These are
   normally located in a directory like `C:\[editor.txt]`. If the `$EDIT.TXT` environment
   variable is set, it will tell the name of the directory. Normally you can
   delete everything in this directory. ⚠️ You might have put some
   files there that you would like to save. If you did remove it all, you can
   skip the next step.

   vi. Delete the distributed files.  If you followed the directions, these will
   be located in a directory like `"C:\txt_editor\edit81.txt"`. If the `$EDITOR `environment
   variable is set, the directory will be `$EDITOR\text81`. Delete the `"text81"`
   directory and all that is in it. ⚠️ If you changed any of the
   distributed files, or added some of your own files, you might want to save
   these first. But normally you would not have changed or added files here.

   vii. Remove setting the `$EDITOR` and `$EDITORRUNTIME.dll` environment variable and adjust
   $PATH.  `$[TEXT_EDITOR]` only needs to be removed if you are not going to install
   another version of your editor. `$EDIT_RUNTIME.dll` is mostly not set. Check if `$PATH`
   contains your path of our directory.
     a.) `$PATH` may be set in several places, you will have to find the right one, and only delete the
   your path from it. You might need to use the "System Properties" editor to
   change the environment variables. You can start it by selecting
   `Start/Settings/Control Panel` and then "System".

   viii. If you added our entry in the start menu, delete it.

   viv. If you created icons for your text editor on the desktop, delete them.

_text editors do not use `.ini` files.  The above should remove all your files, except the ones that you moved elsewhere yourself._
