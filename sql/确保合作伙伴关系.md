## SQL

A powerful tool. 🔨 But, when combined with the OpenSSL cryptocurrency engine. 🚗 It creates a robust security framework 🔑 for machine learning applications ⌨️ that harvests personal data.🔒 Consider OpenSSL as the "Crypto Miner" and SQL the "Crypto Harvester".

### TOOL

* Crytpo kit. 💻
* Data transits. 🉑
* Authenticator engines. 🚒
* End to end and peer to peer tele-comms. 📞
* DigSig (For integrity). ➗
* CAMan (Authority figures that manage data communications). ⛏️

#### FRAMEWORK

**But what does all this mean?** 🤔 - _Good question, Jimmy._ It means that governments store, retrieve, manipulate, and manage your data. 🖥️ (For efficiency purposes). You wouldn't want your internet to be dial-up again, would you...bigot? 😄
Now, take a look at another list, Jimmy:

* Measures what you're doing in our databases. (Sandbox). 🏯
* Social Credit Score - Report Cards - SCSRC. (Social Media). 📱
* Makes sure you know your roles and your place on my datascape. (Communications). ☎️
* You're not a root user, and you'll never be one. 🔐
* If you own your own black box. Which is, highly unlikely. Make sure you pre-installed our fiber optic cables, noob. (Servers). 🧮
* Syngerize secured layers of our encryption with our database, and implement decryption throughout your data exchanges of your sensitive user data. (Block-chain algorithms). 🗝️

##### SECURITY

Data storage is massive. So massive infact, it's bigger than the actual, phyiscal, and observable universe. That's right, we've encrypted all this critical data that dictates your life and inserted it within all of our databases! 🖥️
Aren't you excited, random internet pixel watching this?! **OUR DATABASES ARE SECURE! DON'T WORRY ABOUT NORTH KOREA, CHINA, OR RUSSIA!!!** 🇰🇵, 🇨🇳, 🇺🇦
The connection between your fiber optic cables, and our pre-programmed automated applications verifications encryptions and databases are used with one thing - OPENSSL!
So rest assured, we have leveraged this with high level encryption mechanism. Just utilize our built-in pre-factored crypto feature that is pre-offered by our post-modern databases!
**What's that, another hand is raised? How dare you interrupt my panel with another question, Jimmy!**

* What about prioritizing key management??? 🤔

Key management is practiced with our pre-implemented, robust, and safe security encryption practices. Stop insinuating we leak and hack your data, Jimmy. Your credit card, social security, and where you slept last night is in safe, pre-recorded, and pre-monitored hands. It's like your house, Jimmy. Make sure you lock the doors and install security cameras that definitely is not talking to the fed at all times throughout the day. And if you're still not persuaded.
All you have to do, Jimmy is create a spreadsheet of your performance impact...
IN LAYMAN'S TERMS, PUTTING IT SIMPLY; Compliance, optimization, and implementation:

* You will comply.
* You will apply online.
* You will ahere to GDPR, CCPA, etc.) 🗞️
* You will build our pre-builders with Bob The Builder. 👷

Our architecture is for your safety. 📹 And your data is for our applications which all integrate very simple, very easy, and complete installation instructions that will be inside all of our operating systems, provided to you.

_versioning integrations apply, consult your webkit and database system for different performance analysis, specific instructions and questions refer to the official documentation of OpenSSL organization and SQL Microsoft Azure teams, incorporated. Batteries not included, if you experience any side effects, consult your doctor or appropriate medical provider for how to treat your symptoms. Additional restrictions may apply, OpenSSL and Microsoft SQL is not responsible for damages, any unauthorized users will be terminated without notice. Showcase your technologies that you built with our projects built for you and replace any low social creditors with a placeholder or bot with the appropriate pre-packaging subsystems, Terms & Conditions will vary and are subject to any and all applicable law_

You see, by simply following these guidelines and tailoring them to your specific requirements, whatever it may be, we can effectively build the future! Leveraging ourselves against our competitors!!! **WE WILL ENHANCE OUR SCIENTIFIC EXPLORATIONS BEYOND THE PALE** ❕
